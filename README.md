# Individual-Vehicle-Instance-Detection-and-Calculation-Using-YOLOV3
## Overview
You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a CNN architecture for performing real-time object detection. The algorithm applies a single neural network to the full video, and then divides the video into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. For more detailed working of YOLO algorithm, please refer to the [YOLO paper](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf). 

This project aims to count every vehicle (motorcycle, bus, car, cycle, truck, train) detected in the input video using YOLOv3 object-detection algorithm.
